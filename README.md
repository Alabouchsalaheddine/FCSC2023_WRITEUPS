For several years, France has participated in the European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC), a European competition, which opposes around twenty national teams made up of young ethical hackers, aged 14 to 25. In order to identify and select the best French players, ANSSI organizes the France Cybersecurity Challenge (FCSC).

We participated in the 2023 edition of FCSC that took place from 21 to 30 April 2023.

It is one of the best organized CTFs on the infrastructure side, there is also a good community on the Discord of the competition.

You can find here the writups of some challenges that we managed to solve, written by LARAQUI Omar and me (ALABOUCH Salah-Eddine)

Despite being busy on other things during the last four days of the competition, we managed to secure a commendable ranking in an area that we are still exploring.
